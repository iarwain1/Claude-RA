## For T&E Professionals

**Your background**: Familiar with developmental testing, operational testing, MOPs/MOEs, independent evaluation, and military acquisition context.

**Start with**:
- Section 1 (Testing Traditions)—Much will be familiar; focus on the AI-specific adaptations
- Section 4 (Risk, Quality, and Assurance)—Connects to familiar concepts

**Then explore**:
- Section 2 (Experimental Methods)—For statistical rigor beyond traditional T&E
- Section 5.2 (Human Factors)—For human-AI teaming considerations

**Key translations**:
- Benchmarks ≈ DT; operational pilots ≈ OT
- Benchmark scores ≈ MOPs; real-world effectiveness ≈ MOEs
- The DT/OT progression applies; adapt for AI-specific challenges

**What's new for you**:
- Statistical methods for non-deterministic systems
- Benchmark contamination as validity threat
- Continuous evolution during deployment
