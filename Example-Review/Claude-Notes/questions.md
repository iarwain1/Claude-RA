2. How do current LLM agents compare to traditional AI agent approaches?

## Sub-questions

- What role does memory play in agent performance?
- How should agents balance exploration vs exploitation?
- What are the limits of current LLM reasoning capabilities?
- How can agents learn from feedback efficiently?

## Questions That Emerged During Review

- How do different prompting strategies affect agent behavior?
- What benchmarks are most meaningful for evaluating agents?
- How do we ensure agent safety and alignment?

## Answered Questions

- **Q: What is the ReAct pattern?**
  A: ReAct interleaves reasoning traces with actions, allowing the model to reason about what to do next while taking actions. This improves both reasoning quality and task success rates. (yao2023react)
