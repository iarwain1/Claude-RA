# Hierarchical Tags Database for Link Dumps
#
# Structure:
# - Tags are organized into facets (top-level mutually exclusive categories)
# - Within facets, tags can have multiple parents (polyhierarchy)
# - Each tag has: id, name, description, parents[], children[]
#
# Rules (from research):
# 1. Polyhierarchy only within facets, not across facets
# 2. A child must fully inherit from ALL parents (the All-Some Rule)
# 3. Avoid mixing relationship types (is-a vs part-of vs instance-of)
