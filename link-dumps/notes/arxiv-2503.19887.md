## Abstract

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems could pose a threat to national security. This paper presents a timely proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. The paper introduces the concept of 'security-critical' to describe sectors that pose extreme risks to national security, arguing that this describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, and other sectors. The proposal includes a three-pronged approach mirroring US domestic incident regimes.
