## Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of 'full-stack' safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. The research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. The work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems.
