# AlphaXiv - State of the Art Tracker

**URL:** https://www.alphaxiv.org/state-of-the-art
**Type:** Benchmark Tracking Platform / Research Tool

## Overview

Comprehensive benchmark tracking system monitoring "the latest benchmarks and leading models across different AI capabilities." Aggregates performance data from research papers and official model documentation.

## What It Tracks

### Three Broad Categories

**1. Agents**
- Computer use
- Software engineering
- Tool use
- Deep research

**2. Text**
- Math
- Knowledge
- Reasoning tasks

**3. Visual**
- Depth & geometry
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- 3D reconstruction
- Image generation
- Object tracking
- Multimodal understanding

### Scale
Each category contains **multiple benchmarks** - ranging from 19 to 515 datasets per task, providing comprehensive coverage.

## How It Works

**Continuous Updates:**
- Pulls data from published research
- Aggregates official model documentation
- Updates as new models and evaluations emerge
- Provides current metrics rather than static historical data

**Centralized Hub:**
Single location for accessing performance data across many different benchmarks and capabilities.

## Value for Researchers

**Time Savings:**
- Compare model performance across standardized benchmarks
- Identify state-of-the-art results in specific domains
- Track emerging capabilities and improvements
- Access curated evaluation data without manual paper surveying

**Use Cases:**
- Baseline selection for new research
- Understanding current capability levels
- Identifying gaps in model performance
- Competitive analysis of different models

## Significance

**Addresses Information Fragmentation:**
Performance data scattered across many papers and sources. AlphaXiv consolidates this into navigable format.

**Research Enablement:**
Researchers can quickly assess state-of-the-art without extensive literature review, accelerating research planning and baseline selection.

## Relevance

**Critical for AI research benchmarking.** Provides centralized, up-to-date performance tracking across many domains. Saves researchers significant time in understanding current capabilities. Enables informed baseline selection and gap identification.
