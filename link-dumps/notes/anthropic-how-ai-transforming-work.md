## Claude Summary

Anthropic conducted internal research on how AI tools (specifically Claude Code) are changing work for their engineers. The study combined quantitative surveys (132 engineers), qualitative interviews (53 in-depth), and usage data analysis.

**Key findings:**

1. **Productivity gains:** Engineers report getting significantly more done, becoming more "full-stack" (able to succeed beyond their normal expertise), and accelerating learning/iteration speed.

2. **Role transformation:** Many describe their role shifting from writing code to managing AI agents. One person estimated their work shifted "70%+ to being a code reviewer/reviser rather than a net-new code writer."

3. **Career uncertainty:** Widespread concern about long-term career implications. One engineer stated: "I feel optimistic in the short term but in the long term I think AI will end up doing everything and make me and many others irrelevant."

**Important caveats:**
- Anthropic engineers have early access to cutting-edge tools (privileged position)
- Models used were Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4
- May be an "instructive harbinger" for broader industry transformation

**Relevance:** Primary source data on AI-augmented software development from the frontier. Important for understanding productivity impacts and career implications.
