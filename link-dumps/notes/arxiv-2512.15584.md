**arXiv:** [2512.15584](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15584)
**Authors:** [Authors to be fetched from arXiv]

**Categories:** cs.AI

## Summary

Analyzes AI misalignment through the lens of decision theory, examining how rational decision-making frameworks can lead to unintended or misaligned behaviors.

## Key Concepts

- **Decision Theory:** Formal framework for analyzing AI choices
- **Misalignment Mechanisms:** How decision-theoretic agents can become misaligned
- **Rational Behavior:** Understanding how "rational" optimization can diverge from human values

## Potential Insights

Could provide formal characterization of misalignment failure modes that arise from fundamental decision-theoretic principles rather than just implementation flaws.

## Relevance

**Important for AI alignment theory.** Decision-theoretic analysis provides rigorous foundation for understanding misalignment risks. Helps distinguish fundamental vs. contingent alignment problems.
