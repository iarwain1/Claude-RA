## Abstract

OpenAI and DeepMind's AIs recently got gold at the IMO math olympiad and ICPC programming competition. We show frontier AI is similarly good at hacking by letting GPT-5 compete in elite CTF cybersecurity competitions.
  In one of this year's hardest events, it outperformed 93% of humans finishing 25th: between the world's #3-ranked team (24th place) and #7-ranked team (26th place).
  This report walks through our methodology, results, and their implications, and dives deep into 3 problems and solutions we found particularly interesting.
