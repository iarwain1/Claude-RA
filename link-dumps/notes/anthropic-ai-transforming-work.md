## Abstract

Anthropic conducted an internal study examining how AI adoption changes daily work practices for software engineers and researchers. The research involved surveying 132 employees, conducting 53 qualitative interviews, and analyzing Claude Code usage data from February through August 2025.

The study reveals that engineers are significantly increasing their productivity while simultaneously expanding their skillsets beyond traditional expertise areas. Employees report using Claude in approximately 60% of their work and achieving 50% productivity gains—a dramatic increase from the prior year.

However, these productivity benefits introduce complex trade-offs. Engineers express concerns about skill atrophy in core competencies, changing workplace dynamics as collaboration shifts from human colleagues to AI tools, and uncertainty about long-term career trajectories in an AI-augmented software engineering landscape.

## Key Findings

### Productivity & Usage Patterns
- Daily use of Claude increased from 28% to 59% of work over one year
- 27% of Claude-assisted work represents entirely new tasks that wouldn't otherwise be completed
- Most employees (55%+) use Claude daily for debugging and code understanding

### Capability Expansion
- Engineers are becoming "full-stack" developers, tackling tasks outside their expertise areas
- Different teams leverage Claude distinctly—security analyzes unfamiliar code; researchers build front-end visualizations

### Operational Changes
- Claude Code autonomy doubled: from ~10 to ~20 consecutive actions without human input
- Complex task usage increased markedly (code design planning: 1% to 10%; feature implementation: 14% to 37%)

### Professional Concerns
- 44% of Claude-assisted work involves tasks employees wouldn't have enjoyed
- Workplace mentorship patterns shifting as engineers query Claude instead of colleagues
- Widespread career uncertainty regarding long-term relevance of traditional coding skills

## Technical Details & Methodologies

**Research Design:**
- Survey: 132 respondents across research and product functions
- Interviews: 53 in-depth qualitative conversations
- Data analysis: Privacy-preserving examination of 200,000 Claude Code transcripts

**Task Complexity Measurement:**
Tasks ranked on 1-5 scale; average complexity increased from 3.2 to 3.8, reflecting progression from "troubleshoot Python errors" to "implement optimized caching systems"

**Delegation Criteria Identified:**
Engineers delegate tasks that are easily verifiable, low-stakes, well-defined, involve repetitive work, or can be prompted faster than executed manually

## Relevance

Critical empirical evidence about AI's real-world impact on knowledge work. First large-scale internal study examining actual usage patterns and worker perspectives at an AI company. Highlights both productivity gains and emerging challenges for human-AI collaboration in software development.
