## Abstract

Frontier AI systems could pose increasing risks to public safety and security. This paper addresses: **What level of risk is acceptable?**

Two approaches:
1. **Capability thresholds**: AI capabilities beyond which a system is deemed too risky
2. **Risk thresholds**: Direct statements of how much risk would be too much

Example risk threshold: "The likelihood of cybercriminals using an AI system to cause X amount of economic damage must not increase by more than Y percentage points."

## Key Arguments

**Pros of risk thresholds**:
- More principled than capability thresholds
- Directly address what we care about (risk, not capability per se)

**Cons of risk thresholds**:
- More difficult to evaluate reliably
- Requires measuring actual risk impact, not just capability

## Lessons from Other Industries

- **Aviation**: Risk thresholds per flight-hour
- **Nuclear**: Risk thresholds per reactor-year
- **AI**: 12-month temporal scope aligns with business cycles

## Connection to Regulation

The EU AI Act uses compute threshold of 10²⁵ FLOPs to identify "general-purpose AI models" with potential "systemic risk" - this is a capability/compute threshold rather than a risk threshold.

## Claude Summary

This paper addresses a fundamental question in AI governance:

**Core tension**: We want to regulate based on risk, but risk is harder to measure than capability. Capability thresholds are proxies that may be imperfect.

**Framework contribution**:
- Clarifies the distinction between risk, capability, and compute thresholds
- Provides guidance on when each is appropriate
- Draws on established practices from other high-risk industries

**Practical implications**:
- Current regulations mostly use compute/capability thresholds
- Movement toward risk thresholds requires better risk assessment methods
- Both direct and indirect uses of thresholds are valuable

## Relevance

Essential reading for AI governance and policy. From GovAI, one of the leading AI policy research organizations. Provides conceptual framework for thinking about AI regulation thresholds.
