## Abstract

LLMs are demonstrating increasing prowess in cybersecurity applications, creating risks alongside defensive potential.

**Position:** Current efforts to evaluate LLM cyber risks are misaligned with understanding real-world impact. Evaluating risk requires more than measuring capabilities - it demands comprehensive risk assessment incorporating threat actor behavior and potential impact.

## Key Arguments

**Current evaluations miss the point:**
- Focus too narrowly on model capabilities
- Don't model realistic attacker behavior
- Ignore economic and operational factors

**Real-world risk depends on:**
- Whether threat actors would actually adopt LLMs
- Operational advantages over existing methods
- Potential for real-world impact

## Proposed Framework

Risk assessment framework for LLM cyber capabilities incorporating:
- Threat actor adoption behavior
- Operational advantages
- Impact potential

## Case Study Findings

Evaluation of frontier models as cybersecurity assistants:
- **High compliance rates** (models will help)
- **Moderate accuracy** on realistic tasks
- **Moderate overall risk** due to limited operational advantages

## Recommendations

1. Closer academia-industry collaboration
2. More realistic modeling of attacker behavior
3. Inclusion of economic metrics in evaluations

## Claude Summary

This paper argues that cyber capability evaluations are missing the big picture:

**The key insight**: Capability ≠ Risk. A model might be capable of helping with cyber attacks, but if attackers don't adopt it or it doesn't provide meaningful advantages, the real-world risk may be lower.

**Why current evals fall short**:
- Test capability in isolation
- Don't model realistic threat scenarios
- Ignore that attackers have existing tools

**Practical implications**:
- Don't overreact to capability demonstrations
- Focus evaluations on actual risk scenarios
- Consider attacker economics and behavior

## Relevance

Important corrective to cyber capability evaluation hype. Provides framework for more realistic risk assessment. Useful for policymakers and researchers working on AI cyber risks.
