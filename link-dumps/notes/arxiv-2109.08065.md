**arXiv:** [2109.08065](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08065)
**Authors:** [Authors to be fetched from arXiv]
**Date:** 2021-09 (revised)
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML

## Summary

Investigates pathological behaviors of sigmoid activation functions in neural networks, likely examining training instabilities, gradient issues, or other failure modes.

## Key Issues

- **Activation Function Behavior:** Problems with sigmoid functions in deep networks
- **Training Dynamics:** How sigmoids affect learning stability
- **Alternative Solutions:** Better activation functions or mitigation strategies

## Historical Context

While older (2021), this addresses fundamental issues in neural network design that remain relevant for understanding training dynamics and architectural choices.

## Relevance

**Foundation for understanding NN training.** Activation function choice has significant impact on model behavior. Important for understanding why modern architectures use alternatives like ReLU or GELU.
