## Abstract

Defending LLMs against jailbreaks so they never engage in forbidden behaviors is an open problem. The authors investigate jailbreak-defense when only wanting to forbid a narrowly-defined set of behaviors. They find that popular defenses such as safety training, adversarial training, and input/output classifiers are unable to fully solve this problem. They develop a transcript-classifier defense which outperforms baseline defenses.
