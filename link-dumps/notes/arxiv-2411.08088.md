## Abstract

Frontier AI systems pose increasing risks to society, making it essential for developers to provide assurances about their safety. The authors propose a safety case template for offensive cyber capabilities, illustrating how developers could argue that a model does not have capabilities posing unacceptable cyber risks by breaking down the main claim into progressively specific sub-claims, each supported by evidence.
