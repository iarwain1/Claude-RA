# AI Futures Model: December 2025 Update

**URL:** https://blog.ai-futures.org/p/ai-futures-model-dec-2025-update
**Publisher:** AI Futures Project
**Date:** December 2025
**Type:** Forecasting Model / Research Report

## Summary

Updated AI capability forecasting model predicting timelines for major AI milestones, with significantly longer timelines than previous "AI 2027" predictions.

## Key Predictions

### Automated Coder (AC)
- **Timeline:** Median 2031 (Eli's estimate)
- Full automation of coding work

### Superhuman AI Researcher (SAR)
- **Timeline:** Early 2030s
- Full automation of AI R&D

### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
- Advanced capabilities across virtually all cognitive tasks
- Timeline depends on SAR achievement

## Major Changes from Previous Model

### Timeline Extension
Predictions pushed **3-5 years later** than April 2025 "AI 2027" estimates:
- Previous: Superhuman coder around 2026-2027
- Updated: Superhuman coder around 2031-2032

### Primary Driver of Change
"Less effect from AI R&D automation pre-SC"

**Reason:** Previous model didn't properly account for diminishing returns in AI research automation. More realistic modeling of how AI improves AI R&D led to longer timelines.

## Methodology

### Three Integrated Stages

**1. Benchmark Extrapolation**
- Uses METR's coding time horizon suite
- Projects capability growth from current performance
- Moved away from brain-based compute comparisons

**2. AI R&D Automation Modeling**
- Tracks how automation speeds research
- Models both:
  - **Coding automation:** Implementation speed
  - **Research taste:** Judgment in selecting experiments

**3. Post-AGI Takeoff Analysis**
- Models capability acceleration after full AI R&D automation
- Examines recursive self-improvement dynamics

### Transparency Emphasis
"A model is a way to do this transparently and explicitly, as opposed to implicitly and all in our head"

Focus on making assumptions and reasoning explicit rather than relying on intuition.

## Implications

### More Conservative Than Previous Models
Suggests AI capabilities will advance more gradually than some predictions.

### Diminishing Returns Matter
Automation of AI research won't immediately lead to explosive progress - returns diminish as easier improvements are exhausted.

### Benchmark-Based Approach
Moving from compute-based to capability-based forecasting may provide more accurate predictions.

## Relevance

**Critical for AI timeline forecasting.** Represents significant update from well-known forecasting group. Shows how accounting for diminishing returns changes predictions substantially. Important for AI strategy and policy planning.
