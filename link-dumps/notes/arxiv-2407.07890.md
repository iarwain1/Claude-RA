## Abstract

The paper studies training on the test task in evaluation of LLMs. Unlike training on test data, this is not malpractice but describes practices that utilize knowledge about evaluation tasks at training time. The authors demonstrate that training on the test task confounds both relative model evaluations and claims about emergent capabilities. Instances of emergent behavior disappear gradually as models train on the test task.
