## Summary

Simon Willison discusses Chip Huyen's definition of AI agents as LLM systems that plan approaches and execute tools in loops to achieve goals. He connects this to the classic Norvig AI model, categorizing tools as "read-only actions" (sensors) and "write actions" (actuators).

The article emphasizes improving agent planning through:
- Better system prompts
- Clearer tool descriptions
- Simpler function design
- Stronger underlying models

## Key Points

### Agent Definition
- LLM systems that plan and execute in loops
- Use tools to achieve goals
- Connection to classical AI (Norvig model)

### Tool Categorization
- **Sensors** (read-only actions): Information gathering
- **Actuators** (write actions): Environment modification

### Improving Agent Planning
1. Better system prompts
2. Clearer tool descriptions
3. Simpler function design
4. Stronger foundation models

## Relevance

Practical engineering perspective on AI agents from experienced developer. Bridges classical AI concepts with modern LLM-based approaches. Useful for understanding agent implementation.
