# Shallow Review: Technical AI Safety 2025

**URL:** https://shallowreview.ai/
**Type:** Research Catalog / Review Platform

## Description

A comprehensive review platform focusing on technical AI safety research. "A shallow-by-design review of technical AI safety research in 2025: 800+ papers and posts across 80+ research agendas."

## Scope

**Coverage:**
- **800+ papers and posts** catalogued
- **80+ research agendas** organized
- Focus on technical AI safety approaches

## Eight Main Categories

1. **Labs** - Large company research
2. **Black-box safety** - External safety approaches
3. **White-box safety** - Internal mechanism approaches
4. **Safety by construction** - Building safe systems from ground up
5. **AI-assisted solutions** - Using AI for safety
6. **Theory** - Theoretical foundations
7. **Multi-agent** - Multi-agent safety research
8. **Evaluation methods** - Assessment and measurement

## Problem Solved

**Challenge:** Navigating the vast, rapidly growing landscape of AI safety research

**Solution:** Centralized catalog organizing research by approach and agenda, making it easier to find relevant work without deep expertise in every subfield.

## Design Philosophy

"Shallow-by-design" - provides breadth over depth, enabling researchers to:
- Get overview of the field
- Find relevant research agendas
- Identify papers within specific approaches
- Navigate without requiring expertise in all areas

## Intended Audience

- AI safety researchers
- Practitioners entering the field
- Professionals needing to understand current approaches
- Anyone seeking to map the AI safety research landscape

## Value Proposition

Serves as **navigational guide** to the technical AI safety ecosystem rather than providing original research. Addresses information overload problem by curating and organizing existing work.

## Relevance

**Important for AI safety research navigation.** Provides structured access to large body of technical safety work. Useful for understanding different approaches and finding relevant papers. Addresses discoverability problem in fast-moving field.
