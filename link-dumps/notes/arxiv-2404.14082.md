## Abstract

Understanding AI systems' inner workings is critical for ensuring value alignment and safety. This review explores mechanistic interpretability: reverse engineering the computational mechanisms and representations learned by neural networks into human-understandable algorithms and concepts to provide a granular, causal understanding.

It establishes foundational concepts such as features encoding knowledge within neural activations and hypotheses about their representation and computation. The authors survey methodologies for causally dissecting model behaviors and assess the relevance of mechanistic interpretability to AI safety.

The paper examines:
- Benefits in understanding, control, alignment
- Risks such as capability gains and dual-use concerns
- Challenges surrounding scalability, automation, and comprehensive interpretation

It advocates for clarifying concepts, setting standards, and scaling techniques to handle complex models and behaviors and expand to domains such as vision and reinforcement learning.

## Claude Summary

This comprehensive review paper covers the field of mechanistic interpretability (mech interp) with a specific focus on AI safety applications. Key aspects:

**What is Mech Interp**: Reverse engineering neural networks into human-understandable algorithms - potentially as explicit as pseudocode.

**Safety Relevance**:
- Understanding model behavior to predict failures
- Detecting deception or misalignment
- Enabling targeted interventions

**Challenges Identified**:
- Scalability to large models
- Automation of analysis
- Comprehensive vs. partial interpretation
- Dual-use risks (capabilities research disguised as safety)

**Research Directions**:
- Scaling techniques to complex models
- Expanding beyond language to vision, RL
- Setting standards for the field

## Relevance

Essential review for understanding the mechanistic interpretability landscape. Useful for researchers entering the field or policymakers understanding interpretability capabilities and limitations.
