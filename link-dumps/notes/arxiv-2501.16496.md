## Abstract

Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand computational mechanisms underlying neural networks' capabilities. Progress promises greater assurance over AI behavior and insights into intelligence.

Despite progress, many open problems remain before scientific and practical benefits can be realized.

## Problem Categories

### Methodological Problems
- Methods require conceptual and practical improvements
- Current decomposition methods lack solid theoretical foundations
- No formal frameworks for proving interpretations correct
- Heavy reliance on empirical evidence and intuition

### Application Problems
- How best to apply methods for specific goals
- Scaling: interpreting large models is exponentially harder
- New techniques needed for LLMs and complex systems

### Socio-Technical Problems
- Field must grapple with challenges that influence the work
- Social and philosophical dimensions of interpretability

## Key Open Areas

1. **Reverse engineering**: Identifying roles of network components
2. **Neural network decomposition**: Breaking networks into interpretable parts
3. **Concept-based interpretability**: Identifying components for given roles
4. **Predictive applications**: Using mech interp for better predictions about AI systems

## Claude Summary

This paper maps the frontier of mechanistic interpretability:

**Why a roadmap matters**: Mech interp has produced impressive demos but the path to practical impact is unclear. This identifies what needs to be solved.

**Key challenges**:
- Scaling: Current techniques don't scale to frontier models
- Rigor: No formal proofs that interpretations are correct
- Utility: Unclear how insights translate to safety or capabilities

**Who should read this**: Anyone working on or funding interpretability research. Helps prioritize effort toward impactful problems.

**Notable feature**: Synthesizes views from 30 researchers across major organizations - represents community consensus on priorities.

## Relevance

**Foundational for interpretability research.** Comprehensive survey of open problems from leading researchers. Essential for understanding where the field is and where it needs to go.
