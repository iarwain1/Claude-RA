# Introduction to Ergodicity Economics

**URL:** https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/book-introduction-to-ergodicity-economics
**Authors:** Ole Peters, Alexander Adamou
**Publisher:** Santa Fe Institute
**Date:** June 2025
**Type:** Book / Textbook

## Overview

First formal textbook on ergodicity economics, challenging traditional economic theory using physics-based principles. Bridges statistical mechanics and economic decision-making.

## Authors

**Ole Peters:** SFI Professor at London Mathematical Laboratory
**Alexander Adamou:** Former LML colleague

## Core Concept: Time Averages vs Expected Values

**Traditional Economics:** Assumes time averages equal expected values (ergodic systems)

**Ergodicity Economics:** Examines when these **don't** align - many real-world systems are **non-ergodic**

### Key Distinction

- **Expected value:** Average outcome across many systems simultaneously
- **Time average:** Tracking an individual's outcome over time

**Critical insight:** These diverge in non-ergodic systems, meaning individual experiences differ from collective statistics.

## Illustrative Example

**Coin-flip scenario:**
- Heads: +50% wealth
- Tails: -40% wealth

**Expected value calculation:** Appears positive (averaging across many people)

**Time average (individual experience):** Could be declining over repeated flips

**Implication:** Explains why individuals may feel economically worse off despite aggregate statistics showing growth.

## Significance

### Theoretical Innovation
"A radically different starting point" to economics - questions fundamental assumptions about how systems behave.

### Practical Value
Potentially offers solutions to pressing economic problems that traditional frameworks have struggled to address.

### Academic Impact
First formal textbook establishes ergodicity economics as rigorous field of study.

## Applications to Real-World Systems

**Why It Matters:**
Many economic phenomena are non-ergodic:
- Income inequality dynamics
- Investment returns over time
- Risk assessment for individuals vs. populations
- Policy impacts on individuals vs. aggregate measures

**Traditional problem:** Using ensemble averages (expected values) to predict individual outcomes in non-ergodic systems leads to incorrect conclusions.

## Connection to Physics

Uses **statistical mechanics** principles to analyze economic systems, providing mathematical rigor often missing in traditional economic theory.

## Relevance

**Important for economic theory and AI safety.** Challenges fundamental assumptions in decision theory and utility maximization. Relevant for understanding how AI systems should reason about individual vs. collective outcomes. May inform better approaches to forecasting and risk assessment.
