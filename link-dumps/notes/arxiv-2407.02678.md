## Abstract

The advancement of large language models (LLMs) for real-world applications hinges critically on enhancing their reasoning capabilities. In this work, we explore the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through their geometrical understanding. We establish a connection between the expressive power of LLMs and the density of their self-attention graphs. Our analysis demonstrates that the density of these graphs defines the intrinsic dimension of the inputs to the MLP blocks. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and toy examples that a higher intrinsic dimension implies a greater expressive capacity of the LLM. We further provide empirical evidence linking this geometric framework to recent advancements in methods aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
