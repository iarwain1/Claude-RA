**arXiv:** [2512.16856](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16856)
**Authors:** [Authors to be fetched from arXiv]
**Date:** 2025-12
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.LG

## Summary

Examines AGI safety from a distributional perspective, likely considering how safety properties hold across different scenarios, contexts, or deployment distributions.

## Key Themes

- **Distributional Robustness:** Safety guarantees across various conditions
- **AGI Safety Framework:** Theoretical approach to ensuring safe artificial general intelligence
- **Risk Assessment:** Understanding failure modes in different contexts

## Potential Contributions

Could provide new frameworks for thinking about safety that account for distributional shift and varied deployment scenarios rather than single-point safety guarantees.

## Relevance

**Critical for AGI safety research.** Distributional considerations are essential for real-world safety, as systems encounter diverse and unexpected situations. Important theoretical contribution.
