## Abstract

With the advent of 6G communications, intelligent communication systems face multiple challenges, including constrained perception and response capabilities, limited scalability, and low adaptability in dynamic environments. This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the principles, design, and applications of Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI technologies in intelligent communication systems, aiming to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge technologies and practical guidance. First, we outline the background of 6G communications, review the technological evolution from LAMs to Agentic AI, and clarify the tutorial's motivation and main contributions. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive review of the key components required for constructing LAMs. We further categorize LAMs and analyze their applicability, covering Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), and lightweight LAMs. Next, we propose a LAM-centric design paradigm tailored for communications, encompassing dataset construction and both internal and external learning approaches. Building upon this, we develop an LAM-based Agentic AI system for intelligent communications, clarifying its core components such as planners, knowledge bases, tools, and memory modules, as well as its interaction mechanisms. We also introduce a multi-agent framework with data retrieval, collaborative planning, and reflective evaluation for 6G. Subsequently, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of LAMs and Agentic AI in communication scenarios. Finally, we summarize the research challenges and future directions in current studies, aiming to support the development of efficient, secure, and sustainable next-generation intelligent communication systems.
