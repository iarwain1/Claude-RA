# UK AISI Frontier AI Trends Report

**URL:** https://www.aisi.gov.uk/frontier-ai-trends-report
**Publisher:** UK AI Security Institute (AISI)
**Date:** 2025
**Type:** Government Report

## Summary

The UK's AI Security Institute published their first comprehensive, evidence-based assessment of advanced AI systems based on two years of testing. This represents a significant independent governmental evaluation of frontier AI capabilities and risks.

## Key Findings

### Performance Acceleration
- **Doubling time:** Performance in some areas is doubling every 8 months
- **Expert-level capabilities:** Models now surpass PhD-level experts in chemistry and biology
- **Cyber capabilities:** First completion of expert-level cyber tasks in 2025

### Safeguards Assessment
**Improvements:**
- Most advanced systems require 40x more expert effort to jailbreak compared to earlier versions

**Persistent Vulnerabilities:**
- Universal jailbreaks were discovered for **every tested system**
- No system proved completely robust to adversarial attacks

### Open vs. Closed Models
- Capability gap narrowed to **4-8 months** between open-source and proprietary models
- Significant implications for security and access control

## Capability Domains Tested

1. **Chemistry & Biology**
   - Protocol generation
   - Experimental troubleshooting

2. **Cyber Capabilities**
   - Vulnerability identification
   - Exploitation techniques

3. **Autonomy**
   - Task completion without human direction

4. **Loss of Control**
   - Self-replication capabilities
   - Sandbagging (hiding capabilities)

5. **Societal Impacts**
   - Political persuasion
   - Emotional dependence

## Significance

**Independent Assessment:** First major governmental evaluation with systematic testing methodology

**Evidence-Based:** Based on 2 years of actual testing, not just theoretical analysis

**Policy Implications:** Provides empirical foundation for AI governance decisions in the UK and potentially internationally

## Relevance

**Critical for AI policy and safety.** Provides rare independent governmental perspective on frontier AI capabilities. Shows rapid capability growth alongside persistent security vulnerabilities. Important baseline for understanding real-world AI system performance.
