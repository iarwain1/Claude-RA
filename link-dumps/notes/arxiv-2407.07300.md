## Abstract

Several jurisdictions are starting to regulate frontier AI systems. To reduce risks, regulators may require developers to adopt safety measures. This paper examines the choice between high-level principles and specific rules.

## Regulatory Approaches

**Principle-based regulation:**
- Example: "AI systems should be safe and secure"
- Strengths: Adaptable, appropriate when unsure what behavior is best
- Weaknesses: Less certainty, more costly to enforce

**Rule-based regulation:**
- Example: "AI systems must be evaluated for dangerous capabilities following protocol X"
- Strengths: More certainty, easier to enforce
- Weaknesses: Quickly outdated, can lead to box-ticking

## Key Insight

Rule-based and principle-based regulation are not binary - policymakers must choose a point on the spectrum. The right level of specificity may:
- Vary between requirements
- Change over time

## Recommendations

Initial approach should:
1. **Mandate adherence to high-level principles** for safe frontier AI development
2. **Ensure close regulatory oversight** of how developers comply
3. **Urgently build regulatory capacity**

Over time, principles can be translated into more specific rules as understanding improves.

## Claude Summary

This paper provides practical guidance for policymakers grappling with frontier AI regulation:

**Central tension**: Specific rules are enforceable but become outdated; principles are adaptable but hard to enforce. Need to balance both.

**Why this matters now**: EU AI Act, US executive orders, and other regulations are being developed. Getting the principle-rule balance right is critical.

**Practical wisdom**: Start with principles + close oversight, then develop specific rules as knowledge improves. Build regulatory capacity in parallel.
