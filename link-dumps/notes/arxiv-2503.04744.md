## Abstract

Safety cases are "clear, assessable arguments for the safety of a system in a given context" - a widely-used technique across industries for showing decision-makers (boards, customers, third parties) that a system is safe.

## Paper Contents

**Three main areas:**
1. How and why frontier AI developers might want to use safety cases
2. Argument that safety cases would assist fulfillment of Frontier AI Safety Commitments
3. Open research questions on methodology, implementation, and technical details

## What is a Safety Case?

**Definition:** A structured argument that:
- Identifies potential hazards
- Documents mitigations
- Provides evidence for safety claims
- Can be assessed by external parties

**From other industries:**
- Aviation, nuclear, medical devices
- Required by regulators in high-stakes domains

## Why Safety Cases for AI?

**Benefits:**
- Forces explicit articulation of safety claims
- Enables external assessment
- Supports regulatory compliance
- Provides structured framework for safety thinking

**Connection to Commitments:**
- Seoul Frontier AI Safety Commitments reference safety cases
- Provides concrete method to fulfill these commitments

## Open Questions

- How to structure AI-specific safety arguments
- What evidence is sufficient
- How to handle uncertainty
- Integration with existing development practices

## Claude Summary

This paper argues for importing safety case methodology from other industries to AI:

**Why it matters**: Currently, AI safety claims are often vague or ad-hoc. Safety cases provide a structured, assessable format that has worked in other high-stakes domains.

**Key insight**: Safety cases make safety arguments explicit and reviewable. This enables external oversight and regulatory engagement.

**For the field**: Provides framework that could become standard for frontier AI deployment decisions. Connects to policy commitments already being made.

## Relevance

Important for AI governance and safety practices. From UK AISI - the government body working on this. Provides practical framework for structured safety arguments. Relevant to anyone deploying frontier AI systems.
