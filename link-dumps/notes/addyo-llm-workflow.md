**Date:** 2025

## Core Philosophy

**AI-Assisted Engineering**, not autonomous AI coding. Treats LLMs as "powerful pair programmers that require clear direction, context and oversight."

**Fundamental Principle:** Human remains the accountable engineer with AI as powerful assistant.

## Key Workflow Practices

### 1. Planning First

**"Waterfall in 15 Minutes":**
- Start with detailed specifications and project plans
- Rapid structured planning before code generation
- Prevents wasted cycles and confusion
- Clear direction before AI execution

### 2. Iterative, Chunked Work

**Small, Manageable Tasks:**
- Break projects into small pieces
- Request incremental changes, not massive code generation
- Allows course correction at each step
- Prevents confusion from overly broad requests

### 3. Context Provision

**Feed Everything Relevant:**
- Provide all relevant code
- Include documentation
- Specify constraints explicitly
- Use tools like **gitingest** to bundle codebases for model ingestion

**Principle:** Better context = better outputs

### 4. Human Oversight

**Non-Negotiable:**
- "You absolutely have to test what it writes"
- Review all generated code
- Understand what was produced
- Remain the accountable engineer

**Not:** Blind acceptance of AI outputs

### 5. Version Control Discipline

**Frequent Commits:**
- Treat commits as "save points"
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Enable easy rollback of AI missteps
- Document development progress

### 6. Testing Infrastructure

**Automated Feedback:**
- Leverage CI/CD pipelines
- Use linters and automated checks
- Create feedback loops that improve AI outputs
- Catch issues automatically

## Recommended Tools

### Coding Assistance
- **Claude Code** - Coding assistance
- **Gemini CLI** - Command-line coding
- **GitHub Copilot Agent** - IDE integration

### IDE Integration
- **Cursor** - AI-native editor
- **Copilot** - GitHub integration

### Context Management
- **MCP tools** (Context7) - Context packaging
- **Chrome DevTools MCP** - Debugging visibility
- **gitingest** - Codebase bundling

## Overarching Message

**Solid engineering fundamentals + AI acceleration = superior results**

**Not:**
- Autonomous AI replacing engineers
- Skipping planning and testing
- Blind trust in generated code

**Instead:**
- Structured approach with AI assistance
- Maintaining engineering discipline
- Using AI to accelerate, not replace, good practices

## Key Insights

**Planning Velocity:**
Can do comprehensive planning in minutes that would take hours manually.

**Iteration Speed:**
Faster feedback cycles when working in small chunks with clear direction.

**Quality Gates:**
Automated testing and checks ensure AI outputs meet standards.

**Human Judgment:**
Critical decisions, architecture, and accountability remain human responsibilities.

## Relevance

**Important for AI-assisted development practices.** Provides practical, experience-based workflow from industry leader. Emphasizes fundamentals while leveraging AI. Shows how to be productive without sacrificing quality or understanding.
