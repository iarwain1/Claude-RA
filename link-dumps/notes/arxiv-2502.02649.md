## Abstract

This paper argues that fully autonomous AI agents should not be developed. The authors build from prior scientific literature and current product marketing to:
- Delineate different AI agent levels
- Detail ethical values at play in each
- Document trade-offs in potential benefits and risks

## Key Argument

**Risks increase with autonomy:**
- More control ceded to AI → more risks to people
- Particularly concerning are safety risks affecting human life

**"Dual-edged autonomy":**
- Potential gains: Enhanced efficiency, task completion
- Potential risks: Reduced human oversight, ethically questionable outcomes

## Main Finding

**No clear benefit of fully autonomous AI agents identified.**

## Recommendations

1. **Standardized autonomy levels** for better understanding
2. **Technical human oversight** preservation
3. **Policy-level human oversight** while preserving semi-autonomy benefits

## The Autonomy Spectrum

The paper provides framework for thinking about agent autonomy levels and associated risks/benefits at each level.

## Claude Summary

This is a normative paper arguing against fully autonomous AI:

**The core tension**: More autonomy → more capability → more risk. At some point, the risks may outweigh benefits.

**From Hugging Face**: Notable that this comes from a major AI company. Not just academics arguing for caution.

**Practical implications**:
- Preserve meaningful human control
- Define and standardize autonomy levels
- Make informed trade-offs about how much autonomy to grant

**Counterarguments to consider**: Some argue full autonomy is needed for certain beneficial applications. The paper argues the risks outweigh such benefits.

## Relevance

Important position paper on AI agent development. Provides framework for thinking about autonomy-risk trade-offs. Relevant to AI governance and responsible development discussions.
