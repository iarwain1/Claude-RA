## Abstract

An assurance case should provide justifiable confidence in the truth of a claim about some critical property of a system or procedure, such as safety or security. We consider how confidence can be assessed in the rigorous approach we call Assurance 2.0.
  Our goal is indefeasible confidence and we approach it from four different perspectives: logical soundness, probabilistic assessment, dialectical examination, and residual risks.
