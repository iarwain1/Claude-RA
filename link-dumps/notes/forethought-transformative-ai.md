# The First Type of Transformative AI

**Publisher:** Forethought Foundation
**Type:** Research Article

## Main Thesis

Understanding **which AI transformation occurs first** matters as much as timeline prediction, yet receives far less attention. The authors argue that "early transformations change the strategic landscape" by affecting power distribution, available tools, and societal thinking about AI.

## Three Illustrative Trajectories

### 1. Silent Intelligence Explosion
- Modest AI impacts until sudden emergence of superintelligence
- Rapid, discontinuous capability jump
- Minimal warning or preparation time

### 2. Turbocharged Economy
- Economic AI systems drive explosive growth first
- Creates wealth inequality and political upheaval before AGI
- Governments lag behind industry
- Power consolidation in private sector

### 3. Epistemics First
- AI reshapes information discovery, decision-making, and coordination
- Transforms how societies find truth before autonomous agents emerge
- Risk of manipulation vs. truth-seeking

## Key Reasoning

**Against AGI-Only Focus:**
- Technological progress "rarely has large discontinuities"
- Pre-AGI systems will likely be transformative
- Different sequences create different strategic conditions

**Why Sequencing Matters:**
- Earlier transformations are more predictable
- Optimal interventions differ dramatically depending on sequence
- Earlier transformations are currently more neglected in research

## Strategic Implications

**If Silent Intelligence Explosion:**
- Prioritize automating safety research
- Focus on technical alignment solutions
- Prepare for rapid capability emergence

**If Turbocharged Economy:**
- Prepare for governments lagging industry
- Plan for power consolidation
- Address wealth inequality early

**If Epistemics First:**
- Ensure AI systems promote truth over manipulation
- Strengthen information ecosystems
- Build coordination mechanisms

## Core Claim

Transformation **sequencing** deserves equal analytical focus as timeline prediction. The order in which transformations arrive fundamentally shapes our strategic options and optimal interventions.

## Relevance

**Critical for AI strategy and forecasting.** Shifts focus from "when" to "what order," with major implications for prioritization and preparation. Challenges single-path thinking about AI development.
