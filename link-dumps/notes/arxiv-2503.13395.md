## Abstract

Complex systems can be described at myriad different scales, and their causal workings often have multiscale structure (e.g., a computer can be described at the microscale of its hardware circuitry, the mesoscale of its machine code, and the macroscale of its operating system). While scientists study and model systems across the full hierarchy of their scales, from microphysics to macroeconomics, there is debate about what the macroscales of systems can possibly add beyond mere compression. To resolve this longstanding issue, here a new theory of emergence is introduced wherein the different scales of a system are treated like slices of a higher-dimensional object. The theory can distinguish which of these scales possess unique causal contributions, and which are not causally relevant. Constructed from an axiomatic notion of causation, the theory's application is demonstrated in coarse-grains of Markov chains. It identifies all cases of macroscale causation: instances where reduction to a microscale is possible, yet lossy about causation. Furthermore, the theory posits a causal apportioning schema that calculates the causal contribution of each scale, showing what each uniquely adds. Finally, it reveals a novel measure of emergent complexity: how widely distributed a system's causal workings are across its hierarchy of scales.
