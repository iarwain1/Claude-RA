## Abstract

Classical machine learning has been primarily developed for data in Euclidean space, yet modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly structured data that is inherently non-Euclidean. This data can exhibit intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure. This review article provides an accessible introduction to the core concepts underlying this movement and organizes the models into a coherent taxonomy defined by the mathematical structure of both the data and the machine learning model.
