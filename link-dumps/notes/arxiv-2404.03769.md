## Abstract

This paper addresses the urgent need for messaging standards in the operational test and evaluation (T&E) of machine learning (ML) applications, particularly in edge ML applications embedded in systems like robots, satellites, and unmanned vehicles. It examines the suitability of the IEEE Standard 1671 (IEEE Std 1671), known as the Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), an XML-based standard originally developed for electronic systems, for ML application testing. The paper explores extending IEEE Std 1671 to encompass the unique challenges of ML applications, including the use of datasets and dependencies on software. Through modeling various tests such as adversarial robustness and drift detection, this paper offers a framework adaptable to specific applications, suggesting that minor modifications to ATML might suffice to address the novelties of ML. This paper differentiates ATML's focus on testing from other ML standards like Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) or Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), which concentrate on ML model specification. We conclude that ATML is a promising tool for effective, near real-time operational T&E of ML applications, an essential aspect of AI lifecycle management, safety, and governance.
