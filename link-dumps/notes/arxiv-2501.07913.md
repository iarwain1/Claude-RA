## Abstract

AI is transitioning from generative models producing synthetic content to artificial agents that plan and execute complex tasks with limited human involvement.

Companies that pioneered language models have now built AI agents that:
- Independently navigate the internet
- Perform wide range of online tasks
- Serve as AI personal assistants and virtual coworkers

The opportunities are tremendous, as are the risks.

## Three Key Contributions

**1. Problem Identification:**
Uses agency law and theory to characterize problems from AI agents:
- Information asymmetry
- Discretionary authority
- Loyalty conflicts

**2. Limitations of Conventional Solutions:**
- Incentive design may not work for AI agents
- Monitoring limited by uninterpretable decisions
- Enforcement challenges with autonomous systems

**3. Governance Implications:**
New technical and legal infrastructure needed to support:
- **Inclusivity**: Who gets to use/benefit from AI agents
- **Visibility**: Transparency into agent actions
- **Liability**: Accountability for agent harms

## Analytical Framework

Draws on:
- Economic theory of principal-agent problems
- Common law doctrine of agency relationships

## Claude Summary

This paper applies rigorous legal/economic frameworks to AI agents:

**Why the agency framework matters**: Principal-agent problems are well-studied. Applying this framework to AI agents reveals both parallels and novel challenges.

**Key insight**: Traditional solutions (incentives, monitoring, enforcement) may not transfer well because AI agents make uninterpretable decisions. Need new approaches.

**For AI governance**: Provides conceptual foundations for thinking about AI agent regulation. Useful framework for policymakers.

**Publication venue significance**: Notre Dame Law Review is a top legal journal - signals this is being taken seriously by legal scholarship.

## Relevance

Important legal/governance analysis of AI agents. Applies established frameworks to emerging technology. Useful for anyone thinking about AI agent regulation and liability.
