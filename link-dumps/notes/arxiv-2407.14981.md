## Abstract

This paper discusses challenges and open research questions at the intersection of AI governance and technical research. It explores how technical AI researchers can contribute to governance goals and identifies key open problems.

## Key Themes

**Technical approaches to governance:**
- How can technical methods support oversight?
- What verification and monitoring tools are needed?
- How do we measure compliance with safety requirements?

**Accountability and transparency:**
- Technical methods for audit trails
- Interpretability for governance purposes
- Documentation and reproducibility requirements

**Collaboration needs:**
- Bridging technical AI research and policy expertise
- Translating governance goals into technical requirements
- Feedback from deployment to policy

## Open Problems

1. **Compute governance**: How to monitor and regulate computational resources
2. **Model evaluation**: Creating evaluations that inform governance decisions
3. **Deployment monitoring**: Technical tools for ongoing oversight
4. **Verification**: Proving models meet safety requirements
5. **International coordination**: Technical infrastructure for agreements

## Claude Summary

This paper helps frame AI governance as a technical research area:

**Why technical governance matters**:
- Policy without technical grounding may be ineffective
- Technical tools can enable governance at scale
- Some governance goals require technical solutions

**Key gap**: Many governance proposals lack concrete technical implementations. Research on technical governance can bridge this gap.

**For researchers**: Provides a map of where technical contributions to governance are most needed. Useful for identifying impactful research directions.

## Relevance

Important for anyone working on AI policy or governance. Identifies concrete research directions at the technical-policy interface. Helps frame governance as an area where technical research can make meaningful contributions.
