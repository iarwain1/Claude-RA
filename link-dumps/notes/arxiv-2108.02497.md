## Abstract

Mistakes in machine learning practice are commonplace, and can result in a loss of confidence in the findings and products of machine learning. This guide outlines common mistakes that occur when using machine learning, and what can be done to avoid them. Whilst it should be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of machine learning techniques, it focuses on issues that are of particular concern within academic research, such as the need to do rigorous comparisons and reach valid conclusions. It covers five stages of the machine learning process: what to do before model building, how to reliably build models, how to robustly evaluate models, how to compare models fairly, and how to report results.
