2. **Built on Deep Agents architecture**: Handles planning, memory, and sub-agents automatically

4. **Workspace collaboration**: Browse, copy, and customize agents across teams with one-click cloning
5. **Multi-model support**: Choose between OpenAI and Anthropic models
6. **Built-in memory**: Agents remember corrections and updates over time

### Use Cases
Primarily focused on internal productivity:

### Agents vs. Workflows
LangChain emphasizes this is "not a workflow builder" - agents are dynamic and reason on the fly, adapting to new information. For productivity use cases, this flexibility is preferred over rigid workflow definitions.
