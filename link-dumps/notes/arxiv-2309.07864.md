## Abstract

For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions.

Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent agents, but they mainly focus on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities. Actually, what the community lacks is a general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse scenarios.

Due to the versatile capabilities they demonstrate, large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents.

## Framework

The survey presents a general agent framework comprising three main components:
1. **Brain**: LLM as the cognitive core
2. **Perception**: Multi-modal input processing
3. **Action**: Tool use and environment interaction

## Claude Summary

This is one of the most comprehensive surveys on LLM-based agents (86 pages). It provides:

- Historical context: From philosophical origins of "agent" to modern AI agents
- Theoretical framework: Brain-Perception-Action architecture
- Capability analysis: Why LLMs are suitable agent foundations
- Application survey: Current uses and implementations

The survey is valuable for understanding the agent paradigm that has become dominant in AI development.

## Relevance

Foundational survey for LLM agent research. Essential reading for understanding the agent architecture paradigm and its evolution.
