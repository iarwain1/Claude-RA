## Abstract

AI governance frameworks increasingly rely on audits, yet the results of their underlying evaluations require interpretation and context to be meaningfully informative. The authors propose 'audit cards' to make context explicit, identifying six key types of contextual features to report: auditor identity, evaluation scope, methodology, resource access, process integrity, and review mechanisms. Analysis of existing evaluation reports finds significant variation in reporting practices, with most reports omitting crucial contextual information.
