## Main Thesis

Documents will increasingly come with machine-verified checklists demonstrating they meet quality standards across multiple LLM platforms. This will fundamentally change how we establish trust in LLM-generated content.

## Two Complementary Verification Approaches

### 1. Formal Verification
**Established Methods:**
- Using Lean for verifying LLM-generated mathematical proofs
- Unit tests for code verification
- Already standard practice in mathematics and programming

### 2. Self-Verification Prompting
**Novel Approach:**
- Prompt LLMs to generate both content AND verification mechanisms
- Instead of "give me the answer," ask "give me a way of verifying that the answer is correct"
- Produces superior results compared to simple answer requests

## Applications Beyond Mathematics

**Practical Domains:**
- Tax returns
- Legal memos
- Insurance claims
- Infection prevention plans
- Any field requiring compliance verification

## Key Insights

### Impact on Credentials

**Traditional View:** LLMs will increase reliance on reputation and credentials

**Cunningham's Counter-Argument:**
Improved verification could actually **diminish credential dependency**. "If someone entirely unqualified makes a breakthrough," they can now prove it through rigorous verification rather than relying on institutional authority.

### Cost-Benefit Framework

**Greatest Value:**
LLM verification provides most value where traditional verification is expensive.

**Cost Distinction:**
- **Cheap to verify:** Code tests, formal proofs (already well-served)
- **Expensive to verify:** Medical papers, complex analyses (highest potential impact)

## Implications

**Trust Mechanisms:**
Shifts from "trust the source" to "verify the claims"

**Democratization:**
Could reduce barriers for non-credentialed experts to contribute verified work

**Quality Assurance:**
Standardized verification checklists could become industry norms across domains

## Relevance

**Important for AI verification and trust.** Proposes practical framework for establishing reliability of LLM outputs. Shows how verification might reshape credentialing and expertise validation. Relevant for domains requiring compliance and quality assurance.
