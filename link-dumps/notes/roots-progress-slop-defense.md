# In Defense of Slop

**URL:** https://newsletter.rootsofprogress.org/p/in-defense-of-slop
**Author:** Crawford (Roots of Progress)
**Type:** Blog Post / Essay
**Topic:** AI-generated content

## Main Thesis

AI-generated "slop" (low-quality content) is genuinely problematic but represents an inevitable and ultimately beneficial byproduct of technological progress. Lower production costs drive both quality decline AND transformative opportunities.

## Core Economic Argument

**Universal Pattern:**
"When the cost of creation in a medium falls, the volume of production greatly expands, but **the average quality necessarily falls**."

**Historical Examples:**
- Printing press → flood of low-quality pamphlets
- Internet → spam, clickbait, misinformation
- AI → slop

This pattern is cyclical, predictable, and has accompanied every major media technology.

## Acknowledged Downsides

**Real Problems:**
- Noise and clutter
- Difficulty finding quality content
- Degraded signal-to-noise ratio
- Manipulation and misinformation

Crawford doesn't dismiss these - acknowledges slop is genuinely problematic.

## Accompanying Benefits

### 1. More Experimentation
Lower barriers enable diverse creators to try new approaches without massive investment.

### 2. Removal of Gatekeepers
Traditional editors and publishers no longer monopolize what gets published.

### 3. Accessibility
Unknown creators can build audiences without institutional support.

**Example:** Crawford's own writing reached 50 subscribers initially - traditional publishing would have rejected it.

### 4. Niche Content
Creators can serve smaller, passionate audiences profitably.

### 5. Artistic Freedom
Lower costs reduce corporate profit-pressure on creative work.

## Supporting Evidence

**Harry Potter Example:**
Rejected by twelve publishers before success - illustrates how gatekeepers miss exceptional work.

**Personal Experience:**
Crawford built substantial audience starting from zero, impossible in traditional media landscape.

## Proposed Solution

**Not:** Reject technology or impose restrictions

**Instead:**
1. **Better discovery tools** - Improved filtering and recommendation systems
2. **Thoughtful consumption** - Individual media literacy and conscious consumption
3. **Accept trade-off** - Recognize that abundance requires accepting some noise

## Prediction

"A golden age of creativity" despite present noise.

**Requirements:**
- Technologists improve information filtering
- Individuals become more conscious consumers
- Society adapts to abundance rather than scarcity model

## Counter-Arguments Addressed

**Gatekeeper Defense:**
Yes, gatekeepers filtered some bad content - but also blocked much good content.

**Quality Decline:**
Average quality falls, but peak quality and diversity increase.

**Information Pollution:**
Real problem requiring better tools, not technological retreat.

## Relevance

**Important for AI impact debates.** Provides historical context for content abundance concerns. Argues for adaptation and better tools rather than restriction. Relevant for understanding trade-offs in democratized content creation.
