## Abstract

Generative, multimodal AI offers transformative potential across industries, but its misuse poses significant risks. While prior research has explored potential exploitation of advanced AI systems, there has been limited concrete understanding of how GenAI models are specifically exploited in practice.

This paper presents a taxonomy of GenAI misuse tactics, informed by:
- Existing academic literature
- Qualitative analysis of ~200 observed incidents (January 2023 - March 2024)

## Key Findings

**Prevalence of low-tech misuse**: Most misuses are easily accessible by broad range of actors, often driven by financial or reputational gain.

**Misuse Goals:**
- Opinion manipulation
- Monetization & profit
- Scam & fraud
- Harassment
- Reach/amplification

**Modalities exploited**: Image, text, audio, video

**Key insight**: GenAI amplifies existing threats by lowering barriers to entry rather than enabling fundamentally new attack types.

## Taxonomy Categories

1. **Exploitation of GenAI capabilities** - Using GenAI outputs for malicious purposes
2. **Compromise of GenAI systems** - Attacking the systems themselves

## Claude Summary

This is one of the first systematic empirical studies of actual GenAI misuse in the wild:

**Why empirical data matters**:
- Theoretical risk analyses may overestimate exotic threats
- Real-world data shows what attackers actually do
- Informs prioritization of safety measures

**Key takeaway**: The main threat isn't sophisticated novel attacks but democratization of existing harmful capabilities. GenAI makes it easier for more people to do things that were previously harder.

**Implications for safety**:
- Focus defenses on common, low-tech misuses
- Don't over-index on rare sophisticated attacks
- Information ecosystem integrity is a major concern

## Relevance

Essential reading for understanding the actual landscape of GenAI misuse. Provides empirical grounding for safety discussions that often rely on hypotheticals. From a major AI lab (DeepMind) with access to real incident data.
