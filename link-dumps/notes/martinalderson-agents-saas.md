**Author:** Martin Alderson
**Type:** Blog Post / Industry Analysis

## Main Argument

AI agents will disrupt the SaaS industry in a manner similar to how software disrupted traditional industries. Organizations increasingly can build internal tools with agents rather than purchasing specialized SaaS products, fundamentally changing the build-versus-buy calculus.

## Evidence and Observations

### Current Trends

**Developer Behavior:**
- Using agents to create internal dashboards instead of buying analytics platforms
- Building video processing tools with agents rather than purchasing SaaS solutions
- Creating UI mockups internally instead of subscribing to design tools

**Enterprise Impact:**
- Companies questioning SaaS renewal quotes
- Evaluating whether to build tailored solutions instead of paying for enterprise software
- Eliminating unused features by building exactly what's needed

### Specific Examples

Organizations are replacing:
- Analytics dashboards
- Back-office tools built on customer data
- Internal workflow applications
- Custom reporting systems

## Industry Implications

### Categories at Risk

**High Threat:**
- Back-office tools and analytics dashboards (most easily replaced)
- Software built primarily on customer's own data
- Tools with many unused features
- Simple CRUD applications

### Categories with Moats

**Protected Categories:**
- Payment processing (requires extremely high uptime)
- Systems handling massive data volumes
- Products with strong network effects (e.g., Slack)
- Platforms with proprietary datasets
- Software with strict regulatory requirements

### Competitive Dynamics

**Widening Gap:**
Creates advantage for technically sophisticated organizations over those without strong technical capabilities. Companies able to build custom agent-powered tools will reduce infrastructure costs while less technical organizations remain dependent on SaaS products.

## Implications for Vendors

**Strategic Questions:**
- What unique value does the SaaS product provide beyond what agents can build?
- Does the product have network effects or proprietary data?
- Are reliability requirements beyond what internal teams can achieve?

## Relevance

**Important for SaaS industry and AI agents.** Provides concrete examples of agent-driven disruption already occurring. Shows practical impact on software economics and make-or-buy decisions. Relevant for understanding which software categories face displacement risk.
