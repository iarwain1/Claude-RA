## Abstract

AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations.

As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. The authors propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical framework.

## Claude Summary

This paper proposes concrete safety architectures for LLM-based agents, addressing a critical gap between agent capabilities and deployment safety. The three proposed frameworks represent different design patterns:

1. **Input-output filter**: External safety layer that screens agent actions
2. **Integrated safety agent**: Safety module embedded within the agent system
3. **Hierarchical framework**: Multi-level safety checks with escalation

The work is practically oriented toward real-world deployment scenarios where agents interact with human teams. Relevant for understanding how to implement AI control measures in practice.

## Relevance

Directly relevant to AI safety and control discussions. Provides concrete architectural patterns for implementing safety measures in deployed AI agents. Useful for AI governance and responsible deployment frameworks.
