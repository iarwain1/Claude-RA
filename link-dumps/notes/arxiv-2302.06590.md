## Abstract

Generative AI tools hold promise to increase human productivity. This paper presents results from a controlled experiment with GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer.

Recruited software developers were asked to implement an HTTP server in JavaScript as quickly as possible. The treatment group, with access to the AI pair programmer, completed the task 55.8% faster than the control group.

Observed heterogenous effects show promise for AI pair programmers to help people transition into software development careers.

## Claude Summary

This is one of the earliest rigorous empirical studies of AI coding assistance impact on productivity. Key findings:

**Main result**: 55.8% faster task completion with GitHub Copilot

**Methodology**:
- Controlled experiment with professional developers
- Standardized task (HTTP server implementation in JavaScript)
- Treatment vs control group design

**Heterogeneous effects**:
- May particularly benefit those transitioning into development careers
- Suggests AI assistance could democratize coding access

This paper is frequently cited in discussions about AI impact on labor markets and the economics of AI tools.

## Relevance

Important empirical evidence for AI productivity impact. Useful for discussions about AI tools' effects on software development and labor markets.
