## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. Process link dump files to extract relevant sources
2. Add extracted references to references.yaml
3. Prioritize reading queue

### Short-term
1. Find and fetch high-priority papers (METR, Scale, OpenAI studies)
2. Read and summarize key papers
3. Develop Part 2 (Literature Review) content

### Medium-term
1. Continue Appendix A drafting (Section 1.5 next)
2. Synthesize findings by subtopic
3. Refine framework based on literature
