# Open Research Questions

## Core Questions (from handoff document)

### The Benchmark-Utility Gap
- Why is there such a large gap between benchmark performance and real-world productivity gains?
- What factors determine whether benchmark gains translate to operational value?
- How can we predict which AI capabilities will transfer to real-world settings?

### Evaluation Methodology
- What level of evaluation rigor is appropriate for different decision stakes?
- How should evaluation be adapted for continuously-updating AI systems?
- What are valid baselines for comparing AI-assisted vs. non-AI work?
- How do we evaluate "vibes" - quality aspects that practitioners recognize but can't articulate?

### Human-AI Teaming
- What determines who benefits from AI and who doesn't?
- How does AI proficiency develop? What training interventions work?
- How do we achieve appropriate trust calibration in human-AI teams?
- What is the timeline for user adaptation and skill development?

### Organizational Impact
- What complementary investments are required to realize AI productivity gains?
- How long before AI productivity gains materialize at the organizational level?
- How do task-level gains aggregate (or fail to aggregate) to job and org levels?

### Risk and Safety
- What failure modes are most important to test for in different use cases?
- How should evaluation scope be matched to risk levels?
- What monitoring is needed post-deployment?

## Unresolved Questions from Previous Conversations

1. **Publication venue**: Academic paper? Government report? Internal document?
2. **Classification level**: Are there classified/sensitive considerations?
3. **Military-specific terminology**: How much should be explicit vs. kept in analogies?
4. **International/allied perspectives**: Should these be included?
5. **Case studies**: Real or hypothetical scenarios?

## Questions to Investigate During Literature Review

- What are the most rigorous productivity studies, and what do they actually show?
- What evaluation frameworks exist for AI systems in operational contexts?
- What does the autonomous systems T&E literature say that transfers to GenAI?
- What are the best examples of organizational AI adoption studies?
- What monitoring approaches have been proposed for deployed AI systems?
