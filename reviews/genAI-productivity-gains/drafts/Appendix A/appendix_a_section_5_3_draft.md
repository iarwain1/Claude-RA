# Appendix A, Section 5.3: Organizational Behavior and Change Management

## Overview

Organizational behavior studies how organizations function; change management addresses how to navigate organizational transitions. AI adoption is organizational change—it affects roles, processes, skills, and relationships. Understanding organizational factors is essential for interpreting AI evaluation results.

AI deployment doesn't occur in a vacuum. Organizational context—leadership, culture, processes, incentives—shapes whether AI succeeds or fails. The same AI may produce different results in different organizational contexts.

## Core Concepts

### Technology Adoption Models

**Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**: Adoption depends on:
- **Perceived usefulness**: Will this help me do my job better?
- **Perceived ease of use**: Is this hard to use?

These perceptions—not objective capability—drive adoption behavior.

**Diffusion of Innovations**: Adoption follows patterns:
- Innovators (2.5%): First to adopt, willing to take risks
- Early adopters (13.5%): Opinion leaders, respected
- Early majority (34%): Deliberate, adopt when proven
- Late majority (34%): Skeptical, adopt when pressure builds
- Laggards (16%): Traditional, adopt only when necessary

**UTAUT** (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) integrates multiple models, adding:
- Social influence: What do important others think?
- Facilitating conditions: Resources and support available
- Demographic moderators: Age, gender, experience

For AI, adoption models predict:
- Perceived usefulness and ease of use drive adoption
- Adoption won't be uniform—expect different groups
- Early adopters differ from later adopters
- Social influence matters—what peers do affects adoption

### Absorptive Capacity

Organizations differ in ability to recognize, assimilate, and apply new knowledge. **Absorptive capacity** determines whether organizations can benefit from new technology.

Absorptive capacity depends on:
- **Prior relevant knowledge**: Foundation for understanding new technology
- **Internal communication**: Sharing knowledge across the organization
- **Learning orientation**: Culture of learning and experimentation
- **Resources for experimentation**: Slack to try new things

Organizations with low absorptive capacity may struggle to benefit from AI regardless of AI capability. They can't effectively learn how to use it.

### Organizational Change Models

**Lewin's model**: Unfreeze → Change → Refreeze
- Unfreeze: Destabilize current state, create readiness for change
- Change: Implement new practices
- Refreeze: Stabilize new state, reinforce new practices

**Kotter's 8 steps**:
1. Create urgency
2. Build guiding coalition
3. Form strategic vision
4. Communicate vision
5. Remove obstacles
6. Create short-term wins
7. Build on change
8. Anchor in culture

**ADKAR model**: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement

These models highlight that technology deployment is organizational change requiring deliberate management, not just technology installation.

### Resistance to Change

Resistance arises from:
- **Uncertainty** about the future and personal impact
- **Loss** of competence, status, or control
- **Perceived threats** to job security
- **Poor communication** or lack of involvement
- **Bad past experiences** with change initiatives

Resistance isn't irrational—it often reflects legitimate concerns about poorly planned change. Distinguishing legitimate concerns from resistance per se is important.

For AI, resistance may reflect:
- Concerns about job security
- Doubts about AI reliability
- Frustration with poor AI tools
- Valid questions about AI appropriateness

### Implementation Science

Why do implementations succeed or fail?

**Implementation fidelity**: Was the intervention delivered as intended? Did people actually use AI? How did they use it? Were training and support provided?

**Contextual factors**: Organizational readiness, leadership support, resources, culture.

**Adaptation**: How was the intervention adapted to local context? Some adaptation is necessary; too much adaptation loses the intervention's essential elements.

**Implementation outcomes**: Not just effectiveness but adoption, fidelity, penetration, sustainability.

AI implementation success depends on more than AI capability—organizational factors determine whether capable AI delivers benefits.

### Organizational Culture

Culture—shared values, beliefs, and norms—shapes how technology is adopted and used:

**Learning culture**: Openness to experimentation, tolerance for failure
**Risk culture**: Attitudes toward risk and uncertainty
**Innovation culture**: Value placed on new approaches
**Trust culture**: Trust in management, in technology, in each other

Culture affects AI adoption:
- Learning cultures may experiment more freely
- Risk-averse cultures may adopt cautiously
- Innovation-oriented cultures may push boundaries
- Low-trust cultures may resist AI surveillance concerns

## What Transfers to AI Evaluation

**Adoption models** help predict and interpret adoption patterns. Who adopts? Why? What predicts adoption?

**Absorptive capacity** explains organizational differences in AI benefits. Some organizations can learn from AI; others struggle.

**Change management** frames AI deployment as organizational change requiring active management.

**Implementation research** highlights organizational factors affecting outcomes. AI capability isn't enough; implementation matters.

**Culture** shapes AI adoption and use. Same AI may succeed or fail in different cultures.

---

## What Breaks for Generative AI

**Slower change context**: Traditional change models assumed slower change than AI brings. Change may not "refreeze" before next wave.

**Clearer technology**: AI is more ambiguous than technologies change models were developed for. Capability and appropriate use are less clear.

**Individual vs. organizational**: Much AI adoption is individual-level, harder to manage than organizational-level change.

**Continuous change**: AI keeps changing; there's no stable "after" state to stabilize.

---

## What Can Be Adapted

**Phased rollout strategies** that manage organizational change through stages.

**Readiness assessment** before AI deployment to identify organizational barriers.

**Change management support** alongside AI deployment, not just technical implementation.

**Ongoing adaptation** that expects continuous evolution rather than one-time change.

---

## Implications for AI Evaluation

**Evaluation results depend on organizational context.** Same AI may perform differently in different organizations. Consider context in interpreting results.

**Failed pilots may reflect change management**, not AI limitations. Distinguish AI problems from implementation problems.

**Assess organizational readiness** before expecting benefits. Low absorptive capacity limits what AI can do.

**Support ongoing organizational learning** about AI. AI benefits may require sustained investment in learning.

**Consider adoption patterns.** Who adopts AI? Early adopters may not represent typical users.
